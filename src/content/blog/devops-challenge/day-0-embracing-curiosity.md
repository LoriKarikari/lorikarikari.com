## Introduction

[A post on r/devops](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/15q1jt6/free_devops_150_days_practical_exercises_for/) caught my eye while browsing Reddit.
It announced a unique challenge â€“ a marathon of 150 DevOps exercises! I couldn't resist the chance to test my skills, so I signed up as an early adopter.
In a series of posts, I will tell you how I dealt with this challenge and what I learned along the way.

## What is the DevOps Challenge

The challenge was created by Reddit user _u/raidingBear_ and aims to provide 150 hands-on exercises. It's assumed that you already know a little about DevOps, so they won't teach you everything from scratch. At the moment, you can sign up to be an early adopter and join the Discord community, where weekly exercises will be added. There are no solutions yet for the exercises, but I think they will be added at the end of every week. Or maybe we will discuss our solutions with other members. It's just getting started, so I'm not sure how it will work out. But I'm excited to find out!

## Why I'm Taking on the Challenge

**Sharpening my skills:** With years of experience in DevOps, I've gathered substantial knowledge,
but this challenge will give me the chance to expand my skills and see things from new angles.

**Getting involved with a community and mentoring:** This challenge not only gives me the chance to meet other DevOps enthusiasts,
but I can also learn from their unique experiences. I also want to share my insights with others and contribute my knowledge to the community,
while learning from the diverse experiences of fellow participants. This dynamic exchange of information aligns with my curious nature.

**Giving Back:** After completing the exercises, I intend to provide comprehensive feedback to help refine them for future participants.

## Conclusion

I'm very excited and curious about
the DevOps challenge. I'm not just here to learn, I also want to have fun. Furthermore, I will write about my experiences on my blog,
share them on social media, and add my solutions to GitHub. If you would like to join me on this journey, please let me know.
