## The Debate Around Certifications

Certifications have long been viewed as a mark of expertise in various fields. But something has been bothering me for a while. Many people are getting certifications without studying and doing actual work. Instead, they use courses that are tailored to just pass these exams, or even worse, things called "dumps" - a set of questions and answers that are part of the real exam. The result? Many people who are certified but don't have much experience.

I admit that I was hesitant to get certifications myself because of this trend. I was worried that they might lose their value or importance in the face of such challenges to their integrity.

## The Importance of Hands-On Experience

I cannot stress enough the significance of hands-on experience. It's not enough to cram information from a textbook or memorize answers from a dump. Real learning and growth happen when you get your hands dirty, experimenting, failing, and ultimately succeeding in solving real-world problems.

Think of it this way: Would you trust a pilot who aced all the theoretical exams but had never flown a plane? The same principle applies in tech. Building labs, tinkering with infrastructure, and working on actual projects are the best ways to develop the skills and intuition needed to excel in your field.

Combine certification preparation with hands-on work. Apply what you've learned in the real world, whether through personal projects, contributions to your organization's infrastructure, or by solving complex challenges. This fusion of knowledge and practical experience will set you apart in the industry.

## AWS Certifications as a Learning Path

Don't be the professional who collects certifications like infinity stones without understanding the underlying concepts. Instead, use certifications as tools to guide your learning and validate your skills.

For me, preparing for AWS certifications has been very helpful for learning new things and expanding my skills. They make learning easy by letting you cover a wide range of topics, even those you might have missed in your daily work.

## Conclusion

If you approach certifications with the right attitude, they can be helpful for learning and advancing your career. The important thing is to understand that just having certifications doesn't make someone an expert. True expertise comes from a combination of knowledge, hands-on experience, and a passion for continuous learning.

Definitely get AWS certifications to learn more and impress potential employers. But always remember that your journey should be more than just getting certificates. It should be about becoming a skilled cloud engineer who can confidently navigate the complexities of AWS and the ever-changing world. Keep building, keep learning, and let certifications be a part of your journey, not the end.
